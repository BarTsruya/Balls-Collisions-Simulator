# Balls-Collisions-Simulator
This simulator will show you the behaviour of balls with different mass or radius when they collide with each other in a closed room.

Before you can run the simulation, you need to set up the environment.
The system will allow you to add 8 different balls, when adding a ball has several steps:
1. Creating new ball - done by clicking on the button "New Ball" appears down on screen. If the user regret or one of the ball parameters wasn't determined as he wanted, the user can delete this ball by clicking on the "Delete" button.
2. Choosing position - when your new little ball has been created, you can move your mouse on the screen to choose where to set its initial position. To confirm the position, click on the mouse.
3. Choosing radius - after the balls position has been determined, the balls radius will be changed according to the distance between the mouse and its center. The user can move the mouse until he satisfied from the ball size, then one click on the mouse will confirm the radius. The ball radius limited by a minimal radius and a maximal radius.
4. Choosing mass - when the ball position and radius have been determined, the next one to determine will be the mass. A zero digit immediately  will be shown in the center of the new ball as an initial mass. To change it, the user can type another number (limited to 3 digits number) for the mass. The user can erase the number by clicking on the backspace key. How does the user confirm the mass? Not by clicking on the mouse this time, but by pressing enter on keyboard.
5. Choosing initial velocity - the last thing the user will determine is the initial velocity - presented as an arrow between the balls center and the mouse. The velocity consist of the the arrow direction and also its length. To confirm the velocity, the user will click on the mouse. Once the user starts the simulation, the system will normalize the magnitude of all balls velocities. The normalization will be done by a maximal initial speed allowed by the system.

When step number 5 ends, the new ball gets in color, and is added to the system's balls list.

Note: If your new ball is in non-phisical position, which is when its on the bords or when it has a big radius such that it covers another existing ball, then a red X will show up on your ball. In this case, choose a different position, or diferrent radius. I also remind that you can delete this ball in any moment and create another one.

To the physics lovers - unfortunately, this simulator shows the behaviour of the balls with no respect to their rotation and energy lost by friction.

To start the simulation, just press the big "Start Simulation" button in the lower right corner!
